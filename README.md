# 100-Days-of-Code - My Journey

**Start Date:** April 09, 2025.
**Goal:** Code for 100 days, track progress, and build real-world skills.

# Introduction 

I started learning to code / programme since 17th of November 2024. I have built little projects to reinforce what I have learnt and have pushed these projects to my github, you can view my <a href='https://github.com/decencyokobia?tab=repositories' target='_blank' title="decency's github repositories">repositories</a>. I have created this repository to document my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Wish me luck! Let's go!

# Day 1 - April 09, 2025.

After sometime I have finally built my own website by refactoring a ready-made template to get my website up and running as well as learn how to modify other people's code and not causing a bug or break in the architecture. My website has an about me section, portfolio, blog and contact pages. I had a great time costomizing it to my own taste. Also I had started learning react since 16th March 2025, so i have created a todolist and an expense tracker multiple times and also learnt how to useState, useEffect (but likely in API request and also tracking changes in my todolist and expense tracker for localstorage purposes) and building reusable UI components (main purpose of react as a javascript library). Since i had to put these on my portfolio, had to learn how to host react projects on github via gh-pages. Finally hosted both after long hours of googling and asking chatGPT questions. It was quite simple when i was doing the next one after the first. 

**learning point:-** 

1. Website creation
2. Build and deployment of react + typescript projects
3. Implementation of localstorage to store todolist and expense tracker data.

**Challenges:**

It was all good stuff all the way. I had challenges while trying to make my react projects live and had to work with JSON files to make that the strict and homepage was all configured to build and deploy my react project. Even after i had finished, I went back to rebuild the todolist and expense tracker to implement localstorge and also configure the files for deployment whuch was a little bit challenging but this time i forced my brain to recall and understand why i had to make what and what. 

**Reflection:-** 

The most interesting part of my journey so far is that 5 months ago, I didn't know how the web worked and now I have started to figure something out and makes me want to learn more. I am excited about learning more about APIs, handling more complex state management in React and soon Next.js to build beautiful web applications.

**Goal:-**

My next goal will be to refresh my mind on how to fetch data with axios using weatherApi free apikey. Hopefully this week and finish my course on how to build a video game fetching app using chakra, but trust me I am taking it slowly as this is the best way I assimilate things.
